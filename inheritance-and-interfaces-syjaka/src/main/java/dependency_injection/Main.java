     * This main method and the accompanying Application and PrinterWithTimestamp
     * classes demonstrate how to use inheritance and polymorphism in Java. It also
     * demonstrates a pattern called dependency injection.
     *
     * First, read the source code and comments of the Application class and the
     * PrinterWithTimestamp class.
     *
     * Note that the Application class does not directly use the
     * PrinterWithTimestamp class, but it uses the PrintStream class, which is a
     * superclass of that class.
     *
     * The familiar System.out object is an also an instance of the PrintStream
     * class, so it can be used in the Application by passing it in the constructor.
     * However, we are not limited to just using the System.out object in the
     * Application. We can also use any other PrintStream objects, such as our own
     * PrinterWithTimestamp.
     *
     * This way we can modify the behavior of the Application class without changing
     * its code by passing in a different PrintStream object. This pattern is called
     * dependency injection and it is a common way to make code more flexible and
     * reusable.

        Application app = new Application(System.out);
        app.run();

        PrinterWithTimestamp printer = new PrinterWithTimestamp();
        Application appWithTimestamp = new Application(printer);
        appWithTimestamp.run();

        /*
         * After running the code, try creating an Application and passing in an
         * instance of the PrinterWithTimestamp class as an argument.
         *
         * PrinterWithTimestamp printer = new PrinterWithTimestamp();
         * ...
         *
         * Then run this class again and see what happens.
         *
         * What a nice way to change the behavior of the Java class without changing its
         * code, right? This is especially useful when you are using a class that you
         * cannot modify, such as a class from a third-party library.
