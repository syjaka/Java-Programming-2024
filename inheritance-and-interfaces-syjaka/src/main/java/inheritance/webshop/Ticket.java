/**
 * The Ticket class represents a concert or sports event ticket in a webshop.
 * Like the Vehicle class, the Ticket class should inherit the Product class.
 *
 * In real life a ticket would likely have additional properties, such as the
 * event date and time (LocalDateTime). In this exercise, you can decide
 * yourself which properties you want to add. You can also decide yourself how
 * the toString() method should look like.
 *
 * This class will not be autograded, so it is up to you to test it. You can
 * also skip this class and continue with the next part of the exercise if you
 * feel that you have understood the concept of inheritance.
